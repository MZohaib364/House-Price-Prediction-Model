# House Price Prediction Project Exploring scikit learn

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices demonstrating a basic flow of ML projects and a little exposure to scikit learn for supervised learning. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the median value of homes in different areas.

## Steps Followed

1. **Dataset Upload**
   - The dataset is uploaded and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis and modeling.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, min, and max values are calculated for each feature.
   - **Value Counts**: The distribution of categorical variables like `CHAS` is examined.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data is identified and appropriately handled to ensure a clean dataset for modeling.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Any outliers present in the data are detected and dealt with accordingly.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Histograms**: Used to display the distribution of each feature.
   - **Correlation Heatmaps**: Used to visualize the correlation between features.
   - **Scatter Plots**: Display relationships between individual features and the target variable `MEDV`.

5. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Features are scaled to ensure they are on a comparable scale for the model.

6. **Splitting the Data**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to allow for model training and subsequent evaluation on unseen data.

7. **Pipeline Creation**
   - A machine learning pipeline is created, combining data preprocessing steps with the model training process.

8. **Cross-Validation**
   - Cross-validation is performed to evaluate the model’s performance across different subsets of the data, providing a more robust assessment.

9. **Model Training**
   - Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) are trained on the training dataset.

10. **Model Testing**
    - The trained model is tested on the test dataset to evaluate its generalization performance.

11. **Model Evaluation**
    - The model’s performance is assessed using metrics such as RMSE and MAE to measure prediction accuracy.

12. **Results Visualization**
    - Visualizations such as predicted vs. actual value plots are used to compare the model’s predictions with the actual outcomes.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to follow the steps and build the model.

## Results
The model's performance was evaluated based on prediction accuracy, and further steps can be taken to improve the model by fine-tuning or using more advanced techniques.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow for predicting house prices. It can be expanded further by experimenting with different models, hyperparameters, and more complex data preprocessing techniques.
